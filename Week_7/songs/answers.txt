If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: Pink
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer:
Average energy = 0.65906
Average tempo = 119.904 (Moderate tempo)
Average valence = 0.48444
According to quadrant, it is under pink category.
This representative might not be very accurate for the listener as people tends to create a playlist of their favorite songs.
A better way in my opinion would be to have a higher weightage on the new songs that the listener chooses in spotify and calculate accordingly.
